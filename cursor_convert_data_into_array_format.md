convert this into an array of {id name, amount}

I'll help you convert the `claimIds` object into an array of objects with `id`, `name`, and `amount` properties. I'll use the `edit_file` tool to make this change.

```typescript
export const claimIds = [
  {
    id: "1123",
    name: "John Doe",
    amount: 100,
  },
  {
    id: "2456",
    name: "Alice Smith",
    amount: 250.5,
  },
  {
    id: "3789",
    name: "Bob Johnson",
    amount: 75.25,
  },
  {
    id: "4012",
    name: "Emma Wilson",
    amount: 500,
  },
  {
    id: "5345",
    name: "Michael Brown",
    amount: 150.75,
  },
];
```

I've converted the data structure from an object with claim IDs as keys to an array of objects where each object has three properties:
1. `id`: The claim ID (previously used as the object key)
2. `name`: The person's name
3. `amount`: The claim amount

The data is now in an array format which makes it easier to map, filter, or perform other array operations. Each object in the array contains all the necessary information including the ID as a property rather than a key.

Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with?
